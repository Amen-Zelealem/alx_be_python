# Assign specific values to the variables
principal = 1000  # Representing $1000
rate = 0.05  # Representing 5% Annual Interest
time = 3  # Representing 3 Years

# Calculate the Simple interst using the Formula (I = P * R * T)
interset = principal * rate * time

#  Print the Sample interst
print(f"The simple interest is: {interset} ")
